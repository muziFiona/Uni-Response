#### The relationship between capacitors and resistors

The resistor is to change the tempo/ rhythm of the oscillator, and each resistor work out with the tempo with its own function (for light sensor, speed change when we cover it by fingure; potentiometer changes the tempo when we adjust its controller and with capacitive touch, sound will only comes out when two people are connected by hands.) 

Changing the type of capcitor won't affect the tempo that is adjusted by resistor.
When using the cermaic capacitor, the sound we got was quite sharp and high, and the 1uF capacitor gets the low sound (a light sound, not quite strong), and using the 10uF capacitor gets a loud-low voice.
