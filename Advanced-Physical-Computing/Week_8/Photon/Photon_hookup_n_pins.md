Here is the official web link to tell you how to setup your component and the basic pins to control the outcome. 

Set up your own Wifi (hotspot) and connect it to Photon via the app. (The WiFi is your own hotspot!!!! Not any wifi from the board!!!)

### Pins and Structure

[![Photon Board Detail](https://www.electronicwings.com/public/images/user_images/images/Particle_Photon/What%20is%20particle%20photon/Pin%20details%20copy2.jpg)](https://www.electronicwings.com/particle/particle-photon-board)

D7 is the pin with LED on it, so you don't really need to connect to a breadboard to test its connectivity. 

After you have setup through the app "Particle IoT" (ios/android), with set WiFi, go to the "Tinker" on the app and you can start control. 

As D7 comes with LED, you don't need to connect to any components for first time. Press D7 and set this as digitalWrite and this LED will lights up when it is HIGH, and off when it is LOW. 

Or if you are connected to a breadboard, simply hook up a LED on the pin A0-A7 (only A0-A5 shown on board, A6 and A7 are invisible but should be refer to DAC and WKP) and D0-D7.

#### D0-D7 => GIO pins

A GPIO pin is a 'general purpose input/output' pin. This is by default only high or low (voltage levels, high being the micro controller's supply voltage, low usually being ground, or 0V). But the levels of 'high' and 'low' are usually given as voltages as a proportion of the supply voltage. So anything usually above 66% of the supply voltage is considered a logic level 'high' which means some lower voltage devices can talk with high voltage devices as long as the levels fall within what is considered 'high'. A 1.8â€“2.7V low power microcontroller or GPS receiver for example will have trouble communicating directly to a 5V microcontroller because what the low voltage device sees as 'high' the higher voltage device will not think it's high at all. This is for using GPIO as an input pin, and output is basically the same - the output high is based on the supply of the controller, where it will drive current out and set the voltage of that pin to VCC, or sink current and pull the pin to 0V for a logic 'low'.

#### A0-A7 => analog-to-digital

In electronics, an analog-to-digital converter (ADC, A/D, or A-to-D) is a system that converts an analog signal, such as a sound picked up by a microphone or light entering a digital camera, into a digital signal. An ADC may also provide an isolated measurement such as an electronic device that converts an input analog voltage or current to a digital number representing the magnitude of the voltage or current. Typically the digital output is a two's complement binary number that is proportional to the input, but there are other possibilities.

The Arduino can input and output analog signals as well as digital signals. An analog signal is one that can take on any number of values, unlike a digital signal which has only two values: HIGH and LOW. ... The function used to output a PWM signal is analogWrite(pin, value). pin is the pin number used for the PWM output.

### Pin Detail Diagram of Particle Photon

3V3: This pin is the output of the on-board regulator and is internally connected to the VDD of the Wi-Fi module. When powering the Photon via VIN or the USB port, this pin will output a voltage of 3.3VDC. This pin can also be used to power the Photon directly (max input 3.3VDC).

NOTE: When powering the Photon via this pin, do not put power on the VIN pin.

GND

WKP: This is an active-high input that allows you to wake-up the module from sleep/deep sleep modes. When not used as a WAKEUP, this pin can also be used as a digital GPIO, 

ADC input or PWM.

VIN: This is the power supply pin to the Photon with a voltage range of 3.6 to 5.5VDC (internally regulated down to 3.3VDC). When the Photon is powered via its USB port, this pin will output a voltage of approximately 4.7VDC.

Why 4.7 and not 5?

Well, the actual voltage will be the USB voltage, which is normally 5, minus the forward voltage drop (0.3V) of the protection diode.

D0 - D7: These are digital only GPIO pins.

A0 - A5: These can be used as digital GPIOs or as ADC inputs channels.

DAC: This pin can be used as a digital GPIO, ADC input or as a DAC output.

RX: Primarily used as UART RX, but can also be used as a digital GPIO, ADC input or PWM.

TX: Primarily used as UART TX, but can also be used as a digital GPIO, ADC input or PWM.

PWM: It has On-board 9 pins or channels (i.e. D0, D1, D2, D3, A4, A5, WKP, RX and TX) for PWM generation. The PWM pins are shown in above image named as TIMx_CHx i.e. 

TIM3_CH1, TIM3_CH2, etc.

RST: This is an active-low reset pin for the Photon.

VBAT: Supply to the internal RTC, backup registers and SRAM (1.8 to 3.3VDC).

SPI: It has two On-board hardware SPI, namely SPI and SPI1.

      The SPI pins on Particle Photon are as follows,      

|SPI                                        |                     SPI1                          |

|MISO       |- A4                           |                     MISO       |- D3              |

|MOSI       |- A5                           |                     MOSI       |- D2              |

I2C: It has one I2C port. SDA and SCL pins are available on D0 and D1 pin respectively.
