# Week 8 Practice

## Research on Our Own ->Photon IOT  Wi-Fi Board

We have a choice to research either the Photon IOT  Wi-Fi Board or the Adafruit nRF52840, and we have choose to research on the Wi-Fi Board. We control it by connecting to a hotspot, download the app from Photon and should be able to control on phone or laptop.

### Solder the Adafruit nRF52840 

Although I should be in researching about the details of the Wi-Fi Board, I got a chance to tryout soldering the Bluetooth board as well, this may help me to solve out the issue about my TFT soldered board, the reason it didn't work might be "not soldered well".

#### The solder progress
