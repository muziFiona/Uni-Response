# Week2-Advanced Physical Computing

### Lab 00 - Leds in Serial and Parallel

LEDs in Serial can only have up to 2 LEDs with the a 220 resistor

### Lab 02 - Potentiometers (Knobs)
Experimenting with potentiometers, the speed of the LED sparks faster when it is on

### Lab 04 - Playing with Common Sensors

### Square FSR
This is a Force Sensitive Resistor, which value goes up when force given to the sensor, nothing change when there is no force on it
