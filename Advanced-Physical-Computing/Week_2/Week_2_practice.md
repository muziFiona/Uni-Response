### Lab 00 - Leds in Serial and Parallel

LEDs in Serial can only have up to 2 LEDs with the a 220 resistor

LEDs in Parallel can have up to 6 LEDs with a 220 resistor

However, when I talked to my classmate, they were able to insert more than 20 LEDs in one breadboard, and they stopped because it's out of space. So I go back to think about the issue I might have. 

As I used different colour of LEDs in this case, this may lead to different result compare to same color of LEDs. Therefore I took more orange LEDs (around 30) to try for second time. 
Eventually, all LEDs were still on and I just run out of LED.
Hence I might need to calculate out the max number of LED I can have with one 220 resistor.



### Lab 01 - Serial Data
Explore Serial Monitor base on https://github.com/phoenixperry/cci-ual-pcomp/blob/master/week02/hello/hello.ino
Serial Data with 3 options, if user press O, arduino will introduce me, if N for no, it will keep asking why, and finally with the 'the end of story

### Lab 02 - Potentiometers (Knobs)
Experimenting with potentiometers, the speed of the LED sparks faster when it is on

### Lab 04 - Playing with Common Sensors

### Square FSR
This is a Force Sensitive Resistor, which value goes up when force given to the sensor, nothing change when there is no force on it
