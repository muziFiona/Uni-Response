# Week 5 - LOG for Project 

Last week I have presented my Project Proposal to the class about a "Fortune Telling Machine" which was approved afterwards.

Here I am going show a more detail design about this machine (more concept drawings and how it works).

## The Wheel of RUNES
![Concept image](https://github.com/muziFiona/Uni-Response/blob/master/Advanced-Physical-Computing/Week_5/media/The_wheel_01.jpg)

A wheel will be split into 26 parts, 25 for runes, and one for starting point, everytime it ends the pointer will return to the centre point instead of any other rune places

## Design for the Machine

[![Concept image](https://github.com/muziFiona/Uni-Response/blob/master/Advanced-Physical-Computing/Week_5/media/The_wheel_02.jpg)](https://youtu.be/sWQf0j5OthM)

[Input]Potentiometer for adjusting mode for user (mode 1, mode 2 and mode 3)

[Input]Button for start the game

[Input]Phototransistor could be use for making the rotation stop, when the user put the hand in front of the centre, the pointer will stop and show the final result on screen with lighting on the selected Rune.

[Output]Motor for spining the pointer, (spin randomly to generate 1 of the 25 result)

[Output]LEDs, when the spin ends, the LED will lights up where the pointer stop

[Output]Screen under the wheel, where to show the users the result, and the meaning, also presenting instruction of how to play it.

## Week 6

I have order parts from online and waiting to be delivered. 

Parts such as the screen, motor, photoresistor and potentitometer. 

## RUNES

There are 24 runes in total but 25 for fortune telling, the 25th one is blank and representing Karma (what you have done is the result you get)
