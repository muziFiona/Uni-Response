# Week 9 Practice

## Creating Circuit board using Eagle

This lesson we were thought to use Autodest Eagle to build up a digital circuit board which can actually save as a file for PCB print out. 

I have followed the sparkfun tutorial to export gerber.

First to create the schematic, then use that to generate the board file, where I need to organise all the connection point, as well as checking any overlap point and correct. 

After everything is done, use CAM Processor to generate the zip file which is reday for PCB print.
