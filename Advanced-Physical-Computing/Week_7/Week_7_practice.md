# Week 7 Practice - Shift Register

Found the solution of how to connect 26 LEDs for my final project through this lesson. 
Shift register is quite useful to me for the project as I have a lot Leds to connect, as well as connecting screen and buttons. 

### Fail in first attempt

The tryout at claas did not really work out. The LEDs sparked randomly and I feel like it was not the right outcome. So I took the Shift Registor home for more attempts.
