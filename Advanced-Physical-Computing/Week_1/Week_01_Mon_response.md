###ISSUES!!
In response to create Simon Says game, I tried to look up for tutorial online as it requires coding for the structure. 
Here are some examples I have found that seems possible to create with materials I have got:

As in practice 2, we have done something with the button that requires code:

And so I initially thought that it could be simple to add some control base of the button, but obviously it isn't the way. 
After many research and tryout, it turns to the following situation....

And after many tryouts again the board seems to be dead and no response.....
Before it get no response, it seems to work properly but only two LEDs work, and later on, those two died as well. 

I was not able to complete the little game for Week 1 response although with finished lab practice, I am hoping to fully understand its structure and what is the possible way to create this game without a "buzzer" and maintain using only the same amount of resistor as the number of LEDs (as from most of the examples and tutorials they required double amount of resistors and need buzzer within production, and I was not able to find the way to get rid of code that is for the buzzer reaction. )
